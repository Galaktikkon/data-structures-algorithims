# Task:
# Write a function that receives two sequences: A and B of integers and returns one sequence C.
# Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A (maintaining the order) except those,
# that are present in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.

# Example:
# A = [2, 3, 9, 2, 5, 1, 3, 7, 10]

# B = [2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 10, 6, 6, 1, 7, 10, 10, 10]

# C = [2, 9, 2, 5, 7, 10]


# Notes:

# 1. The time complexity is important â€“ try to write an algorithm with good time complexity and specify it in your answer.

# 2. You can choose any reasonable type present in your chosen language to represent the sequence.

# 3. Make sure the function signature is correct.

# 4. Write your own code to test primality.

# 5. Make sure your code is not outputting anything on standard output. If you want to leave us a hint how to run your code - place it in a comment.
